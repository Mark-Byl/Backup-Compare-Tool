# Backup Compare Tool
Custom tool to backup and compare FANUC robots. Coded in Python.
Created by Mark Byl - 2023

# Features
This program allows you to backup and compare FANUC robot data.

It is currently configured to compare .ls and .va files, but feel free to change this in the FileExtension json file.

You will need to edit the RobotInfo json file in this folder to your robot names and IPs, maintaining the same format.

Note that backing up robots may take up to a minute per robot.
